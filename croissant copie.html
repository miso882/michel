<h4>INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
<p>THE DOUGH</p>
<li>Pour the milk into a saucepan and heat over a low heat (or in the microwave in 10-second intervals) 
until it reaches 40'C. If you don't have a food thermometer, you want it to be around the same temperature 
as your skin.</li>
<li>Remove the milk from the heat, stir in 20g sugar and then add the dried yeast. Stir,
 cover with a tea towel and then leave in a warm spot for 5-10 minutes. It should form a 
 lovely froth on top when it's ready.</li>
<li>Add the remaining caster sugar, gluten free flour, xanthan gum and salt to a large
 mixing bowl and stir well with a wooden spoon.</li>
<li>Cut the cold butter into chunks and add to the flour mix. Using your fingers, rub the 
flour mixture into the butter pieces, until it looks like fine breadcrumbs. Do this until 
there are no big lumps of butter left.</li>
<li>Once the yeast mixture is frothy, pour it into the flour/butter mix. Stir together 
using a wooden spoon until it becomes thick, then use your hands to form it into a smooth, 
slightly sticky dough. Wrap in clingfilm (plastic wrap) and place in the fridge while you 
make the beurrage (butter packet).</li>
</lo>
<p>THE BEURRAGE</p>
<ol>
<li>Lay a sheet of baking paper out on the worktop and dust with ½ tbsp gluten free flour
(plain or bread flour is fine). Cut the cold block of butter into two rectangles and place
down on the sheet next to each other</li>
<li>Sprinkle another ½ tbsp gluten free flour over the top of the butter then cover with 
another sheet of baking paper. Use a rolling pin to press - and then roll - the butter and 
flour out into a rectangle shape, approximately 18cm x 10cm. Use a dough scraper to help keep 
the edges nice and neat!</li>
<li>Once rolled, remove the top sheet of baking paper and wrap the butter packet in the bottom
 sheet. Place in the fridge (on a flat surface so it keeps its shape) until both the dough and
  the butter are the same temperature - around 30-60 mins.</li>
</ol>
<p>CREATE THE FIRST FOLD</p> 
<ol>
<li>When the dough and butter are nicely chilled, remove the dough from the fridge. Place 
a large piece of clingfilm on the worktop and lightly dust with flour.</li>
<li>Place the ball of dough onto the floured clingfilm then roll into a rectangle,
approximately 30cm x 20cm in size and most importantly, around 6mm thick. Use your dough
scraper to try to keep the edges as straight as possible.</li>
<li>Remove the cold butter packet from the fridge and carefully unwrap it. Place is towards
one of the short ends of the rectangle of dough. It should have a small border around the
edges and then a length of dough to one side of it</li>
<li>Roll the dough with no butter on it towards the centre and over the dough</li>
<li>Then carefully roll the uncovered piece of dough and butter back over the top of the first fold</li>
<li>it's time to chill it again. First, mark the short end further away from your with a
 tiny X using a knife. This is because we need to turn the dough a quarter turn each time 
 before rolling again. When you remove it from the fridge, the X will show you which way 
 round the dough was - clever! Wrap the dough in clingfilm and chill for at least 30 minutes.</li>
</ol>
<p>ROLL, FOLD, CHILL, REPEAT</p> 
<ol>
<li>Once the dough has chilled, remove it from the fridge, unwrap it and place it back down on 
lightly floured clingfilm in exactly the same position it was before (using the X to guide you).
 Turn the dough 90 degrees clockwise, then cover with a piece of clingfilm.</li>
<li>Carefully roll the dough out in ONE DIRECTION so it forms a long rectangle, again 
around 6mm thick. Try to keep the edges as straight as possible. You may find it helps to 
press the dough out a little with the rolling pin, before rolling.</li>
<li>Once you have a rectangle, repeat the exact same folding process as before. Mark the
end further from you with an X and wrap and place back in the fridge for another 30 minutes.
When rolling, try to brush off any excess flour with a pastry brush so you don't end up adding
 a lot of extra flour to the mix.</li>
<li>Repeat this process a further two times, and then wrap the dough and place in the fridge for
 30-60 minutes for a final chill. If at any point you start to notice the dough splitting and
exposing the butter, you can gently pat a tiny dusting of flour over the top then brush off any 
excess.</li>
</ol>

<p>SHAPE THE CROISSANTS:</p> 
<ol>
<li>Once your dough has chilled, remove it from the fridge and place it down onto a sheet of clingfilm.
Place another sheet of clingfilm out on top. Carefully roll the rectangle out, as before, into a
rectangle around 6mm thick</li>
<li>Using a sharp knife or pizza cutter, trim the edges so that you have a rectangle of dough.</li>
<li>Use a ruler to measure the longest side and then cut the dough into three rectangular pieces</li>
<li>Next place your ruler diagonally across each rectangle, from corner-to-corner, and cut each piece in half into two triangle shapes</li>
<li>Carefully lift each triangle up from the clingfilm and lay it back down onto a fresh, lightly floured surface. Roll the dough loosely from the larger end of the triangle in a swirl</li>
<li>Place the croissants onto a lined baking tray with plenty of space between them, with the smallest end of the roll on top. Repeat until you have rolled all of the dough.</li>
</ol>



<p>PROVING THE CROISSANTS</p>
<ol>
<li>Once you have shaped all of the croissants, loosely cover them with a lightly oiled piece of 
clingfilm and place in a warm spot to prove. You want them to be room temperature - not too hot.
If it looks like the butter is starting to leak out or melt, return them to the fridge to chill for a little while</li>
<li>These croissants will need to prove for around 60-90 minutes. They will puff up a little and become
marshmallow-y to the touch, and you may start to see some layers on the cut edges.
 Don't expect them to grow a lot like bread though, it's a small difference!</li>
</ol>



<p>CHILL THEN BAKE!</p>
<ol>
<li>Once the croissants have proved, place the tray back in the fridge for an hour. DO NOT SKIP THIS STAGE. It is super important to ensure they are nice and cold when they go in the oven! You can also leave them overnight at this point and then bake them fresh in the morning.</li>
<li>When the croissants have had at least an hour in the fridge, heat the oven to 200'C / Fan 180'C / Gas Mark 4.</li>
<li>Once the oven had reached temperature, remove croissant tray from the fridge. Gently brush the tops of each croissant with a beaten egg (egg wash).</li>
<li>Place the tray into the oven. Bake for 15-20 minutes until they puff up and become flaky and golden. Keep an eye on them - if they turn brown too quickly turn the oven down a little, or place a little foil loosely on top.</li>
<li>Once baked, remove from the oven. Cool on a cooling rack for 5-10 minutes before tucking in</li>
</ol>
